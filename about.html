	<h4>What is FC Hacks?</h4>
	<p>FCHacks is a hackathon geared towards Pittsbugh-area high school students. A hackathon is a competition during which students design, build and bring to life various projects. It is for students interested in all the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). During the course of the day, students will team up to create projects of their choice. It might making an app or building a robot or creating a prototype of something that solves a real-world problem. No prior knowledge or experience needed. We will provide mentorship and training materials during the course of the day to all students. At the end of the day, student teams will have the opportunity pitch their ideas to sponsors and judges and win prizes. Students will also be provided with computers, workshops and tools needed for their project.</p>
	<h4>When will it be?</h4>
	<p>FCHacks is a hackathon on November 13-14, 2020. We will begin the day with a keynote speaker. Students will be given 10 hours to work on their projects. Lunch and snacks are provided! At the end of the day, a science-fair style expo presentation and an awards ceremony.</p>
	<h4>Where?</h4>
	<p>FCHacks will take place at Fox Chapel Area High School, about 20 minutes outside of the City of Pittsburgh. You do not have to be a student in the district to attend the event. All students, including homeschool students, are invited.

	<h4>History</h4>
	<p>FC Hacks was founded by three Fox Chapel Area High School students in 2017. Since then, other schools (e.g. North Allegheny and Pine Richland) have followed our lead and begun their own hackathons. Our school's hackathon continues to attract students from all over the region.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">FAQ</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
<h4>What generally happens at a hackathon?</h4>
<p>During a hackathon, participants ("hackers") work in teams of up to 4 to build projects ("hacks") from scratch. These projects can be pretty much anything—apps, games, robots, websites, or anything else you can dream up!</p>

<h4>What do people usually make?</h4>
<p>There are very few limits on what you can build, but here are some examples of what people have made at other hackathons. Keep in mind that almost all of these projects were created by college students during longer events (typically 36 hours)—your projects at FCHacks do not have to be this elaborate!</p>

<h4>Do I need to have a team or an idea?</h4>
<p>Not at all! You're welcome to start brainstorming or forming a team ahead of time, but this is certainly not required—we'll have dedicated time at the event for you to find a team and come up with an idea.</p>

<h4>What can I win?</h4>
<p>We'll have several prizes at the event, including overall prizes (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and prizes for hacks in specific areas. We'll also have a special prize specifically for beginners.</p>

<h4>Who can attend?</h4>
<p>FCHacks is open to all high school students. If you're younger, email us and we'll see what we can do. If you're older, please consider registering as a mentor or volunteer instead.</p>

<h4>How much does it cost to attend?</h4>
<p>Absolutely nothing! FCHacks is completely free to attend, and, thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, we'll also have lunch and snacks provided throughout the day, as well as materials for you to work with.</p>

<h4>What resources will be available for me?</h4>
<p>We'll have mentors available to help you with various aspects of your project, like iPhone app development or circuit design, as well as optional workshops centered around specific topics, like pitching your project to the judges. We'll also have materials for hardware hackers (think Arduino boards, 3D printers, and soldering irons) and extra resources for beginners.</p>

<h4>What if I've never coded before?</h4>
<p>No problem! One of our main goals is to provide an opportunity for students with little exposure to computer science to see how fun and powerful it can be. If you're a beginner, we'll have intensive introductory workshops teaching you how to code something from scratch, and we'll even provide you with a laptop pre-loaded with the tools you need. We'll also award a special "Best Beginner Project" prize at the end of the event.</p>

<h4>What should I bring?</h4>
<p>All you need to bring is a student (or governement) ID, a laptop (if you don't have one, let us know and we'll see what we can do), physical materials (if you think you'll need them for a hardware hack), and an open mind!<p>

<h4>What kinds of projects can I make?</h4>
<p>You can make anything you’d like. When brainstorming, we recommend thinking of problems that many people face, or some practical application of technology. It’s a good idea to work in an area that you are familiar with, but don’t be afraid to push your boundaries! For some inspiration, you can see what winners of college hackathons have done at devpost.com.</p>

<h4>What technology can I use?</h4>
<p>A variety of hardware is available, ranging from Arduinos to cameras to motors. These can all be found in the library. We also have laptops available for your use, which can be found in computer carts located in several places. You must return the computers you use to the same cart that you got it from, in the right numbered slot.</p>

</h4>What if I don’t have a team?</h4>
<p>No worries! You’ll have time to meet and brainstorm with other hackers. Teams will have to register in the library by 12:00pm.</p>

<h4>Have a question we didn't cover here?</h4>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:team@fchacks.org">team@fchacks.org</a> and we promise we'll get back to you soon!</p>
