<!--	<h4>What is FCHacks?</h4>
	<p>FCHacks is a hackathon geared towards Pittsbugh-area high school students. A hackathon is a competition during which students design, build and bring to life various projects. It is for students interested in all the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). During the course of the day, students will team up to create projects of their choice. It might making an app or building a robot or creating a prototype of something that solves a real-world problem. No prior knowledge or experience needed. We will provide mentorship and training materials during the course of the day to all students. At the end of the competition, student teams will have the opportunity pitch their ideas to sponsors and judges and win prizes.</p>
	<h4>When will it be?</h4>
	<p>FCHacks will take place on September 11-12, 2020. More details on the scedule will come soon. Students will be given 24 hours to work on their projects.</p>
	<h4>Where?</h4>
     <p>Due to COVID-19, FCHacks will be online this year. Competitors will create their projects at home and submit virtually.
 <p>FCHacks will take place at Fox Chapel Area High School, about 20 minutes outside of the City of Pittsburgh. You do not have to be a student in the district to attend the event. All students, including homeschool students, are invited.

	<h4>History</h4>
	<p>FC Hacks was founded by three Fox Chapel Area High School students in 2017. Since then, other schools (e.g. North Allegheny and Pine Richland) have followed our lead and begun their own hackathons. Our school's hackathon continues to attract students from all over the region.</p>

  <h4>About Virtual FCHacks 2020</h4>
  
    <p>
      Due to current circumstances, FCHacks has decided to move to a virtual competition. This event will be 24 hours and will take place Autumn 2020 (13th-14th of November). This hackathon is geared towards high school students, but will be open to 7th and 8th grade as well. Students may work in teams of up to 4 students in the same division.
<br> <br>
      A hackathon is a competition during which students design, build and bring to life various projects. This year, the hackathon will be primarily coding oriented, but we will have two divisions:

          <div class="card-body">
            Develop a computer or mobile application in the programming language of your choice to solve a problem related to a topic. We will provide resources for teams using Java, Python, or Swift, but any language is permitted. The project will be judged based on completeness and features of the code along with the innovation/feasibility of solution.

            For those who have hardware (e.g. microcontrollers) - Develop a physical solution using electronic components of your choice to solve a problem related to a topic. We will provide resources introducing teams to the Raspberry Pi or Arduino microcontrollers, but any platform is permitted (note that desktop/laptop computers and mobile devices do not count as “hardware”). The project will be judged based on the completeness of the hardware and the software. It will also be judged based on the innovation/feasibility of the solution.

    <p>
      The topic will be released on Friday (Nov. 13) at 5:00 PM. You will then have 24 hours to complete your project (until Saturday Nov. 14 at 5:00 PM) and it must be fully submitted by 7:00 PM on the 14th. The project will be submitted as a video presentation, a 1-2 page write-up of the solution, all code files (commented), and, if applicable, photos and demonstrations of the hardware solution.
      <br><br>
      Your project might be making an app or building a robot or creating a prototype of something that solves a real-world problem. No prior knowledge or experience needed. We will provide mentorship and training videos during the day to all students. On Sunday, student teams will be evaluated by judges based on their submissions and an awards ceremony will take place virtually at 5:00 PM.

            <h2 class="mb-4">FAQ</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
<h4>What generally happens at a hackathon?</h4>
<p>During a hackathon, participants ("hackers") work in teams of up to 4 to build projects ("hacks") from scratch. These projects can be pretty much anything—apps, games, robots, websites, or anything else you can dream up! Keep in mind that your project has to fit within a certain theme.</p>

<h4>Do I need to have a team or an idea?</h4>
<p>Not at all! You're welcome to start brainstorming or forming a team ahead of time, but this is certainly not required—we'll have dedicated time at the event for you to find a team and come up with an idea.</p>

<h4>What can I win?</h4>
<p>We'll have several prizes at the event, including overall prizes (1st, 2nd, 3rd) in each division.</p>

<h4>Who can attend?</h4>
<p>FCHacks is open to all high school students and 7th or 8th graders. If you're younger, email us and we'll see what we can do. If you're older, please consider registering as a mentor or volunteer instead.</p>

<h4>How much does it cost to attend?</h4>
<p>Absolutely nothing! FCHacks is completely free to attend.
  <!-- , and, thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, we'll also have lunch and snacks provided throughout the day, as well as materials for you to work with. -->
</p>

<h4>What resources will be available for me?</h4>
<p>We'll have mentors available to help you with various aspects of your project, like iPhone app development or circuit design, as well as optional workshops centered around specific topics, like pitching your project to the judges. 
  
  <!-- We'll also have materials for hardware hackers (think Arduino boards, 3D printers, and soldering irons) and extra resources for beginners. -->
</p>

<h4>What if I've never coded before?</h4>
<p>No problem! One of our main goals is to provide an opportunity for students with little exposure to computer science to see how fun and powerful it can be. If you're a beginner, we'll have intensive introductory workshops teaching you how to code something from scratch, and we'll even provide you with a laptop pre-loaded with the tools you need. We reccomend that you sign up for the beginner programming division,.</p>

<!-- <h4>What should I bring?</h4>
<p>All you need to bring is a student (or governement) ID, a laptop (if you don't have one, let us know and we'll see what we can do), physical materials (if you think you'll need them for a hardware hack), and an open mind!<p> -->

<h4>What kinds of projects can I make?</h4>
<p>You can make anything you like. When brainstorming, we recommend thinking of problems that many people face, or some practical application of technology. It’s a good idea to work in an area that you are familiar with, but don’t be afraid to push your boundaries! For some inspiration, you can see what winners of college hackathons have done at <a href="http://devpost.com">devpost.com</a>.</p>

<h4>What technology can I use?</h4>
<p> For the virtual competition, feel free to use any hardware that you want. This can range from arduinos or Raspberry Pis to EV3s. You can use any sensor electronic component that you have. The minimum you need to compete is a computer, laptop, or smart device with access to the internet.
  <!-- A variety of hardware is available, ranging from Arduinos to cameras to motors. These can all be found in the library. We also have laptops available for your use, which can be found in computer carts located in several places. You must return the computers you use to the same cart that you got it from, in the right numbered slot. -->
</p>

</h4>What if I don’t have a team?</h4>
<p>No worries! You will get a chance to pair up with other competitors who do not have a team. Also, you can be a one person team.
  <!-- You’ll have time to meet and brainstorm with other hackers. Teams will have to register in the library by 12:00pm. -->
</p>

<h4>Have a question we didn't cover here?</h4>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:team@fchacks.org">team@fchacks.org</a> and we promise we'll get back to you soon!</p>
