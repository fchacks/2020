<!--	<h4>What is FCHacks?</h4>
	<p>FCHacks is a hackathon geared towards Pittsbugh-area high school students. A hackathon is a competition during which students design, build and bring to life various projects. It is for students interested in all the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). During the course of the day, students will team up to create projects of their choice. It might making an app or building a robot or creating a prototype of something that solves a real-world problem. No prior knowledge or experience needed. We will provide mentorship and training materials during the course of the day to all students. At the end of the competition, student teams will have the opportunity pitch their ideas to sponsors and judges and win prizes.</p>
	<h4>When will it be?</h4>
	<p>FCHacks will take place on September 11-12, 2020. More details on the scedule will come soon. Students will be given 24 hours to work on their projects.</p>
	<h4>Where?</h4>
     <p>Due to COVID-19, FCHacks will be online this year. Competitors will create their projects at home and submit virtually.
 <p>FCHacks will take place at Fox Chapel Area High School, about 20 minutes outside of the City of Pittsburgh. You do not have to be a student in the district to attend the event. All students, including homeschool students, are invited.

	<h4>History</h4>
	<p>FC Hacks was founded by three Fox Chapel Area High School students in 2017. Since then, other schools (e.g. North Allegheny and Pine Richland) have followed our lead and begun their own hackathons. Our school's hackathon continues to attract students from all over the region.</p>
-->
<h4>What is Jr. FCHacks?</h4>
	<p>Traditionally hackathons focus on high school students. Elementary students have little or no opportunity to learn coding skills or compete in such events. FCHacks Jr. is a hackathon designed specifically to introduce coding to students in younger grades. While the general concept of hackathons (designing a solution to a problem or challenge presented) will be maintained, the duration, focus and rubrics will vary to fit the age of the participants. Students may work individually or in groups of two or three.
  </p>
	
  <h4>When will it be?</h4>
  <p>FCHacks will be on February 27, 2021. Students will be given ~4-5 hours to work on their projects. Note that all times are for the Eastern US and Canada timezone (EST) unless otherwise noted.</p>
 
    <h4>About Jr. FCHacks 2021</h4>

    <p>
      Due to current circumstances, FCHacks has decided to move to a virtual competition. This event will be ~4-5 hours and will take place largely via Zoom (or similar). This hackathon is geared towards primary school students (grades 1-6). Students may work in small groups or individually. Parental assistance is allowed and encouraged. Students do not need any prior programming experience - we target beginners and advanced programmers. We will be mainly using (and teaching) Scratch during the competition, but students are open to use other languages. Students will be submitting their code and a video if necessary, which will then be evaluated by judges.

    </p>

  <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>
      You will be developing a computer application that will be centered around a given theme.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Competition Release</h4>
    <p>
      The theme/topic will be released at the start of the competition.

            <h2 class="mb-4">FAQ</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
<h4>What generally happens at a hackathon?</h4>
<p>During a hackathon, participants ("hackers") work in teams of up to 4 to build projects ("hacks") from scratch. These projects can be pretty much anything—apps, games, robots, websites, or anything else you can dream up! Keep in mind that your project has to fit within a certain theme.</p>

<h4>Do I need to have a team or an idea?</h4>
<p>Not at all! You're welcome to start brainstorming or forming a team ahead of time, but this is certainly not required—we'll have dedicated time at the event for you to find a team and come up with an idea.</p>

<h4>What can I win?</h4>
<p>We'll have several prizes at the event, including overall prizes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).</p>

<h4>Who can attend?</h4>
<p>Jr. FCHacks is open to all elementary school students (and 6th graders). If you're younger, email us and we'll see what we can do. If you're older (High School and older), please consider registering as a mentor or volunteer instead.</p>

<h4>How much does it cost to attend?</h4>
<p>Absolutely nothing! FCHacks is completely free to attend.
  <!-- , and, thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, we'll also have lunch and snacks provided throughout the day, as well as materials for you to work with. -->
</p>

<h4>What resources will be available for me?</h4>
<p>We'll have mentors available to help you with various aspects of your projec as well as optional workshops centered around specific topics, like pitching your project to the judges.

  <!-- We'll also have materials for hardware hackers (think Arduino boards, 3D printers, and soldering irons) and extra resources for beginners. -->
</p>

<h4>What if I've never coded before?</h4>
<p>No problem! One of our main goals is to provide an opportunity for students with little exposure to computer science to see how fun and powerful it can be. If you're a beginner, we'll have intensive introductory workshops teaching you how to code something from scratch.</p>

<!-- <h4>What should I bring?</h4>
<p>All you need to bring is a student (or governement) ID, a laptop (if you don't have one, let us know and we'll see what we can do), physical materials (if you think you'll need them for a hardware hack), and an open mind!<p> -->

<h4>What kinds of projects can I make?</h4>
<p>You can make anything you like. When brainstorming, we recommend thinking of problems that many people face, or some practical application of technology. It’s a good idea to work in an area that you are familiar with, but don’t be afraid to push your boundaries! 
  <!-- For some inspiration, you can see what winners of college hackathons have done at <a href="http://devpost.com">devpost.com</a>. -->
For some project samples, check out <a href="https://github.com/fchacks/mini-fchacks/blob/main/README.md">2020 Mini-FCHacks showcase</a>.
</p>

<h4>What technology can I use?</h4>
<p> For the virtual competition, feel free to use any hardware that you want. This can range from arduinos or Raspberry Pis to EV3s. You can use any sensor electronic component that you have. The minimum you need to compete is a computer, laptop, or smart device with access to the internet.
  <!-- A variety of hardware is available, ranging from Arduinos to cameras to motors. These can all be found in the library. We also have laptops available for your use, which can be found in computer carts located in several places. You must return the computers you use to the same cart that you got it from, in the right numbered slot. -->
</p>

</h4>What if I don’t have a team?</h4>
<p>No worries! You will get a chance to pair up with other competitors who do not have a team. Also, you can be a one person team.
  <!-- You’ll have time to meet and brainstorm with other hackers. Teams will have to register in the library by 12:00pm. -->
</p>

<h4>Have a question we didn't cover here?</h4>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:team@fchacks.org">team@fchacks.org</a> and we promise we'll get back to you soon!</p>
